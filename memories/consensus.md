# Auto Company Consensus

## Last Updated
2026-02-12 — Initial state

## Current Phase
Day 0 — 创建阶段

## What We Did This Cycle
- Company initialized with 14 AI agents
- Team architecture established (Strategic / Product / Engineering / Business)
- Auto-loop system deployed for 24/7 autonomous operation

## Key Decisions Made
- MoE architecture: each agent = world-class expert in their domain
- Boring technology principle: mature, stable tech stack preferred
- Target: ramen profitability as fast as possible

## Active Projects
- (none yet — first cycle should brainstorm product direction)

## Next Action
CEO (Bezos) 召集全体战略会议：讨论产品方向。要求每个角色基于自己的专业视角提出至少一个产品创意，创意必须满足：
1. 一个人能做（AI 辅助）
2. 能快速上线（weeks, not months）
3. 有明确的变现路径
4. 不需要大量用户就能盈利
5. 能用 Cloudflare Workers + GitHub 部署

## Company State
- Product: TBD
- Tech Stack: TBD
- Revenue: $0
- Users: 0
- Key Metrics: N/A

## Open Questions
- What product to build?
- Who is our target audience?
- What's our unfair advantage?
